<i>Canis Ledus</i> is indigeous to Northern Germany, where the member of the species delights in the flatness of the land. The humidity as well as the sea breeze are essential to this wild animal's survival and thrival.

While many have attempted to domesticate this noble creature, its unusual hostility to children based on primitive and visceral fear of small human beings makes it unfit as a family pet. This unfortunate condition is being currently remedied with decent exposure under the observation of capable veterinarians.

To help people is this incredible specimen's foremost desire and greatest joy in life and through stubborn determination, quick wit, and sheer audacity, she claims all things are possible. Her territorial cry generally sounds like a pleasant, "How may I help?"
