            "All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the
            dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was
            vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may
            act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible."

            To write someone's story is to impose an ending, however temporary,
            and as tired and anxious as I am, and I suppose, we all are in one
            way or another, to think... to contemplate an end can be painful.
          </p>
          <p>
            So without further ado, and with great pain and suffering, may I
            present:

          <b>THE STORY OF MY LIFE SO FAR</b>
          <p>
            I was born in 1991 in Ukraine's beautiful capital Kyiv (home of the
            only valid subway system in the world). When I was 11, my family
            moved to Germany, and slowly fell apart. Aw. After a failed career
            as a funeral director (I will take no questions about that.) and
            urged by everyone I knew, as well as my friends at the Agentur f√ºr
            Arbeit, I went to university. After a slight misunderstanding with
            the automated enrollment system, I decided to
            <i>consciously and willingly </i>
            pursue a degree in computer science. Still waiting for disastrous
            consequences, I managed to wrap up my studies with a pleasantly
            surprising A for the bachelor thesis appropriately named
          </p>

            <small> by Leda Wolf formerly known as Lidiia Lazebnikova.</small>
          </p>
          <p>
            Drunk with power brought on by my ineffable academic success, I have
            quickly but nervously moved all three of my belongings to the South
            of Germany, as well as my German Shepherd Doakes, formerly known as
            alive, currently very much dead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working for CarGarantie in Germany's sunniest city Freiburg im
            Breisgau was an experience unlike another: a complex microservice
            architecture that was still being developed at the time, in Poland,
            was to be transferred to CarGarantie's own Software Engineering
            department consisting of maybeeee 5...? developers, and a very eager
            work student. (whaddup Hermann, my favorite German) In the meantime,
            a very naughty CRM based on adito's finest but aging work was being
            used as everything. Combining XML visual changes with JavaScript
            data fetching didn't seem like a good idea at the time, and still
            isn't, but very much solidified my judgement-free Whatever Works
            approach to life, giving me some hefty opinions. I learned Java,
            using the eloquent syntax of Spring and fast bootstrapping of Boot,
            I also overcomplicated at least 2 internal applications with a fully
            React single page frontend, very fashionable at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            But precipitating the new microservice system being labeled a hugely
            failed investment and the devastating security incident that
            absolutely didn't have anything to do with me, I decided to advance
            my career from junior to barely competent up North in the Hansa city
            of Hamburg. After a few brief stations, my new home sum.cumo
            enriched my life with many diverse (technologically) projects and
            razor-scooter-based trips through the halls. It was at that time
            that I understood that just doing backend would not help my Whatever
            Works mentality, and merely give me more hefty radical opinions, so
            I decided to drop backend completely.
          </p>
          <p>
            After two years of frontend bliss with Vue.js in its many but very
            similar shapes, I launched a website with my new employer Tallence,
            but due to fundamental disagreements on the use of outdated
            technology, I became part of Grover, where I rekindled my
            long-standing affair with React, dropping Vue.js like a
            template-tagged ugly potato. There, I also benefitted from a wide
            open free architecture, as diverse and bright as the people of
            Grover themselves and as littered with problems as a landscape would
            allow. I ... loved it.
          </p>
          <p>
            To say it was a bad time would be a lie and also in breach of the
            NDA I had to sign, when restructuring made my position redundant.
            But what I can say is that I am proud of what my team achieved,
            thoroughly described{" "}

            by my most stoic colleague Lauri Viitala. Please clap.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion for testing in its appealing pyramid-shaped form became
            an integral part of my glorious return to backend with Node.js in
            its many a-splendid applications, did I mention Node.js? I think I
            did. Node.js!
          </p>
          <p>
            I look forward to the next chapter that life has in store for me,
            but if I had any requests, I'd love a fullstack role that
            accomodates my eccentric (read{" "}
            <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD">"neurodivergent"</a>)
            nature and allows me to benefit from a multicultural and diverse
            environment with many technological challenges and minimal
            organizational problems. Thank you for your time.
